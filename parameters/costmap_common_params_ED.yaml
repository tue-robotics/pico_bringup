obstacle_range: 3.5 # determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.
raytrace_range: 4.5 #determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading. Setting it to X.Y meters as we have above means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to X.Y meters away given a sensor reading. 

#robot radius overrides the footprint
#footprint: [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ... [xn, yn]]
robot_radius: 0.35 #Here we set either the footprint of the robot or the radius of the robot if it is circular. In the case of specifying the footprint, the center of the robot is assumed to be at (0.0, 0.0) and both clockwise and counterclockwise specifications are supported. We'll also set the inflation radius for the costmap. The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred. For example, setting the inflation radius at 0.55 meters means that the robot will treat all paths that stay 0.55 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost.

# inscribed and circumscribed radius should both be equal to the base RADIUS, since AMIGO has a circular footprint

# The higher the cost_scaling_factor, the faster the costs decrease with increasing distance from the obstacles.
# If the robot cannot navigate through a door, increase this value
